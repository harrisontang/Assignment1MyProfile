						<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My relationship with IT began at six. Christmas Day, 1998.
						My mother had bought me a limited edition Pokemon-themed
						 Nintendo 64 console, with extra controller to boot for my younger
						 brother. My brother and I spent countless nights toiling away at
						 video games and perfecting strategy and technique.
						 <br>
						 Since then, technology has been an ever-evolving presence throughout
						 my life. From growing up with a household fax machine to owning my
						 own laptop and phone, FM Radio to countless hours of music and podcasts
						 (and personalised analytics) a mere swipe away, technology has been
						 a way I interface and experience a world larger than my immediate,
						 physical one. During 2020 technology became the only way to
						 communicate with friends and family, and technology became the
						 obvious tool to combat the restrictive physical distancing of the
						 COVID-19 era.
						 <br>
						 In the future, IT will continue playing a key role in
						 solving issues like climate change, population density and
						 conventions of work and workplaces

						<h2>Choosing RMIT</h2>
					</header>
					<p>After months of researching various IT degrees and online courses,
						an Open Universities Australia student advisor recommended RMIT’s
						IT courses for their popularity, structure, and online support.
						<br>
						Being my first online study degree, having a curated online learning
						experience was important to me. Additionally, several friends and
						peers who have or are attending RMIT review their experiences glowingly.
					</p>
					<header>
						<h2>Expectations</h2>
					</header>
					<p>During my time in this course, I foremost hope to gain a deeper
						understanding and appreciation for the IT industry. I anticipate
						learning about the power and potential IT has on impacting our world
						in profound and positive ways, while grasping significant issues within
						the IT industry and learning towards solutions.
						<br>
						With this knowledge, I aim to expand my employment opportunities into
						exciting IT industries including security, software and application
						development and data research. By the end of this course, many
						industries will have begun moving towards becoming more IT-reliant,
						swelling the need for IT specialists capable of a variety of roles.

						<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My Ideal IT job would involve web design and application development
						at an intersection with my deep hobbies and passions: one of them
						being music. Nightlife Music is a leading music subscription service
						for businesses in the hospitality, tourism, and retail sector.
						<br>
						In their job listing posted on seek.com, they are seeking an App Developer
						experienced with Java, APIs, graphic design, and publishing credit on
						an application on the Apple App or Google Play Store to join their
						existing team of developers to research, design and develop apps with
						the company existing database of music licences.
						<br>
						While I am new to programming in general, I am currently learning Java
						in Introduction to Programming at RMIT but would benefit from learning
						C++ for my Project Idea, while I must expand on experience with graphic
						design. Gaining a degree in Computer Science and working through entry
						level positions to gain experience and credit on smaller projects would
						set me in good stead towards working in this field.

						<h3>Myers-Briggs Personality Test</h3>
						<img src="images/16PersonalitiesType.JPG" alt="Advocate INFJ Type" width="200" style="float:right;">
					<p>According to the free online Myers-Briggs Personalities Test,
						I possess an INFJ or Advocate personality type. These types are
						supposedly the rarest of personalities and are suggested to be
						principled in nature, empathetically sensitive and altruistically
						driven with a strong sense of egalitarianism. However, this idealism
						can evoke perfectionist and reserved tendencies in Advocates,
						exacerbated by a lack of self-care and often leading to burnout.

						<h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>
					<p>According to this free learning styles test, I have an aptitude to
						physical, aural, and social learning. These types of learners typically
						benefit most from hands-on group activities and discussion through
						problems. Physical and Aural learners are encouraged to associate
						learnings through physical and aural experiences, such as touch and
						rhythm, while Social learners are activated through group and social
						interaction to strengthen their assertions.

						<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
						<img src="images/bigFIveEmpathicIdealist.JPG" alt="Empathic Idealist" width="200" style="float:right;">
					<p>Like the Myer-Briggs Test, a Big Five Personality Test is a psychology
						test aimed to measure five major dimensions of personality: Openness,
						Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism (OCEAN).
						According to this test done on truity.com, I possess an accent towards
						Openness and Agreeableness while Neuroticism scored lowest. Aspects
						of this summation mirror certain characteristics of the Advocate
						personality type, such as a tendency towards helping others,
						collaboration, and an aversion towards following traditional paths.

						<header>
							<h2>Test Results</h2>
						</header>
					<p>These test results suggest I am strongly capable of collaboration and
						productive in environments aimed towards helping others, benefitting
						greatly through physical and social experiences.
						<br>
						Possessing a social learning style is valuable in a team environment
						as it describes a heightened capacity for collaboration and communication.
						Additionally, Advocate personality types are considered emotionally
						perceptive, with an aptitude for listening to others and considering
						their views. My Big Five test results reinforce these values in Openness
						and Agreeableness.
						<br>
						These attributes can be beneficial to dynamic team environments in
						opening communications and self-accountability, while mediating common
						situations including personality clashes and stress. Their perfectionist
						and reclusive tendencies can be remedied through approaching team members
						with ideas, suggestions, and issues.
					</p>
					<br>
						<header>
							<h2>Team Influence</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Forming a team with people of similar personality types and learning
							styles is ideal, as streamlining the process of familiarisation and
							expectation can save time and energy for productivity. Open and free
							communication can lead to building rapport with team members, leading
							to a desired outcome agreed between all members.
							<br>
							However, a degree of diversity in background, life experiences,
							personality types and learning styles amongst group members can
							illuminate solutions to issues previously unthought of.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>While I believe tests like these hold a degree of merit, I also believe
						people are deeply sophisticated and personalities (or aspects of) change
						with life experiences and circumstances. In the past, I may have exhibited
						more characteristics of a certain personality type over another, or I
						learned better visually than physically. Also, it is difficult to measure
						consistency in answers to questions from one day to the next as people’s
						approaches to situations often vary. Granted, these are not exact sciences
						and should be taken with a grain of salt.

					<h2>Overview</h2>
				</header>
					<p>A smartphone application that identifies various fruits and vegetables
						and tracks their consumption into personalised data analytics over days,
						weeks, and months. By photographing their produce discoveries, users can
						view descriptions, nutritional values, recipe suggestions and share on
						social media.
						<br>
						Progressively filling the produce catalogue will connect local grocers
						and suppliers with new customers, encouraging users to travel and
						experiment with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, rewarding them with
						vouchers and promotions and thus improving Australian diets through
						variety and discovery.
					</p>
					<br>
					<header>
						<h2>Motivation</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Despite being one of the most food-secure nations in the world, many
						Australians struggle maintaining a recommended diet of two servings of
						fruit and five servings of vegetables per day.
						<br>
						Reports from a 2016 CSIRO study into Australian fruit and vegetable
						consumption showed 51 percent of adults are not eating the recommended
						daily intake of fruit, while 66 percent are not eating enough vegetables,
						citing improved variety and economic accessibility as possible solutions.
						A 2018 Roy Morgan report into total grocery market share showed non-Big
						Four supermarkets held 9.1% of market share, while the Big Four
						(Woolworths Group, Coles Group, Aldi and IGA) made up a combined 80.1%
						of market share.
						<br>
						This means approximately one in ten consumers are shopping at local
						grocers and have access to wider variety. By gamifying healthy eating
						habits, consumers can fulfil their dietary requirements with progression,
						rewards, and interaction (much like how applications like Duolingo and
						Fitbit gamifying language education and fitness respectively).
						<br>
						While there are already plenty of applications that focus on dietary
						consumption and food-journaling, the aim of developing this app is to
						improve fruit and vegetable intake by gamifying the experience of
						discovering, sharing and consuming fresh produce.
					</p>

					<h2>Description</h2>
				</header>
						<p>
						On the consumer level, the application provides customers with product
						information through interaction. It features a catalogue of silhouetted
						fruit and vegetable varieties for users to progressively complete and
						experiment with (with expansions of the catalogue through regular updates
						and fixes).
						<br>
						When a user discovers and consumes a particular produce, they will
						photograph and feed the image through the app, which will return specific
						details on the variety including type, nutritional value, and price
						comparisons between available and stocked suppliers.
						<br>
						Logging a new fruit or vegetable will fill the relative space in the
						catalogue and unlock recipe suggestions, while registering a previously
						logged produce will add “experience”. Over time, gaining experience with
						a particular produce will unlock further recipes and promotions on the
						application.
						<br>
						These interactions are logged onto a food diary and can be optionally
						shared across social medias, providing users recommendations and analytics
						into their fruit and vegetable eating habits across user-defined stretches
						of time.
						<br>
						<br>
						Through this discovery, users can “follow” a favourite supermarket or
						grocer to receive updates on new produce, current stock levels, and
						specials.
						<br>
						On the supply level, smaller fresh food chains and retailers will reach
						out to potential new customers by showcasing greater variety in locally
						stocked fruit and vegetables through the application, while larger chains
						continue to hold the retailer price advantage.
						<br>
						Retailers will receive more targeted analytics on sales and interest
						through social media interaction and data collection. Such an application
						would also be useful to farmers and horticulturists to accurately identify
						differences in crop. There is also latent potential to connect with new
						farmers and suppliers as the userbase grows.
						<br>
						<br>
						Expansion into other countries and territories will provide users with an
						even larger catalogue to complete. Much like popular mobile apps like
						Pokemon GO, travelling across states and countries will be required to
						fill the fresh food catalogue, as certain produce can only be purchased
						and enjoyed in specific regions.

				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					<p>The application will be available on both Android and iOS, utilising
						both camera functionality and GPS, with access to a cloud-based database
						which holds relevant information on foods, userbase and market trends.
						<br>
						Like the popular plant identifying app, Plant Snap, the application will
						require a unique algorithm which identifies common to rare kinds of fruit
						and vegetables through camera sensors and organises user-submitted data
						into a relevant fashion (aligning with consumption analytics, journaling
						and market trends), thus building the database for users to draw from.
						<br>
						Common languages used in app development include JavaScript, Kotlin and
						C++, with the latter being the preferred choice for its compatibility
						with cloud computing apps.
						<br>Presently, app development kits such as Google’s Flutter are becoming
						more accessible to retail consumers and present a compelling,
						cost-effective means for app production. Flutter is an open-source
						project and combines Dart programming language with C and C++.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>This project will primarily require skills in programming, marketing,
						and an understanding of the fresh foods retail space. Programmers adept
						in Dart with a familiarity to C++ programming languages will be required,
						as will experience in cloud-storage and networking. As this will be a
						collaborative project, strong communication between programmers and an
						understanding of GitHub repositories will also be beneficial.
						<br>A marketing and sales team to engage with large and local businesses
						will be necessary to form a client base for providing product information
						to customers.

					<h2>Outcome</h2>
				</header>
					<p>
						The success of this application will be based on user and business
						engagement, as the relationship between food, business and customer is
						the engine behind this app.
						<br>
						With its universal and disruptive approach to fresh foods, it has
						appeal-potential for a wide and consumer-conscious userbase. Farmers,
						horticulturalists, and nutritionists will also find value in the
						application.
						<br>
						By putting more power into the consumer’s hands, they can make more
						informed decisions – gamifying it can deliver more tangibles for the
						consumer in progression, discovery, and education.
						<br>As Australians improve their fruit and vegetable eating habits,
						so will their overall health
